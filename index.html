      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a front-end developer and ex-production assistant based in Jersey City, NJ. I am passionate about emerging technologies and solving problems that improve the relationship between people and the products, systems, and environments that we engage in. 

I recently graduated from Flatiron school after having done full stack development course and was right away given an opportunity at Fog Creek for a fellowship. There I worked with a very talented mentor and polished my front-end skills even more. I also got a glimpse into how a software company operates and became even more excited to have an opportunity to work in such an environment.

I was a stay home mom for last few years but still tried dabbling in my interest of UI development and did HTML/CSS course from SVA. Now that my daughter has started going to school I am ready and full of energy to join back the work force. Before that I worked as a production assistant and decided that my talent was better applied to making things. Programming has become a passion of mine and I spend lot of time now days practicing my learnings by trying to make apps.</p>
