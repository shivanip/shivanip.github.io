    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am a front-end developer and ex-production assistant based in Jersey City, NJ. I am passionate about emerging technologies and solving problems that improve the relationship between people and the products, systems, and environments that we engage in.
    I recently graduated from Flatiron school after having done full stack development course and was right away given an opportunity at Fog Creek for a fellowship. There I worked with a very talented mentor and polished my front-end skills even more. I also got a glimpse into how a software company operates and became even more excited to have an opportunity to work in such an environment.
    I was a stay home mom for last few years but still tried dabbling in my interest of UI development and did HTML/CSS course from SVA. Now that my daughter has started going to school I am ready and full of energy to join back the work force. Before that I worked as a production assistant and decided that my talent was better applied to making things.
    Programming has become a passion of mine and I spend lot of time now days practicing my learnings by trying to make apps.

    <h2><a href="http://shivanip.github.io/git-jQuery-webapp/">My jQuery Adventure</a></h2>
    <p>Being a self taught front-end dev, I try to practice everything I learn by using the knowledge in a live example. While trying my hand in jQuery, I made this little web app that takes in a github username and displays the profile stats of that user.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://shivanip.github.io/backbone-practice/#inTheaters">Backbone JS App</a></h2>
    <p>One can never learn enough in this world of new emerging technologies. But I certainly wanted to know more about how we can use different Javascript frameworks to make a dynamic website. Hence, I came across BackboneJS. And this is the practise webapp that uses the Rotten Tomatoes API and fetches the information about the movies and displays it to the user. It's still a work in progress. </p>
